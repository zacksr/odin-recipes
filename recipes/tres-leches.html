            <li>In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Separate the eggs into two other mixing bowls.</li>
            <li>add 3/4 cup sugar to the bowl with the egg yolks and mix on high speed until yolks are pale yellow. Add 1/3 cup milk and vanilla and stir to combine. Pour the egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and stir gently just until combined (don't over-mix).</li>
            <li>Use electric beaters to beat the egg whites on high speed. As the begin to whip into stiff peaks, gradually mix in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Fold the stiffly beaten egg whites into the better gently, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl, until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth it into an even layer. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow cake to cool completely.</li>

            <li><strong>Make Ahead Instructions:</strong> You can make tres leches cake 1-2 days in advance. In fact, I love to make this cake the night before so that the cake has a lot of time to soak up the milk mixture.</li>
